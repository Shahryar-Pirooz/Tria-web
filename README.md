# Tria Password Manager

Tria is a simple password manager that generates a random password based on three inputs provided by the user. If the three inputs are the same, the generated password will also be the same. Tria is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0.


## Usage

Using Tria is simple, all you need to do is to give Tria

- A name, which can be any name you like (e.g. Michael)
- A simple code that's easy to remember (e.g. 1234)
- A domain of the website you want the password for (e.g. facebook.com)
You donâ€™t need to remember or take note of the password because you can always come back, input the name, code, and domain and Tria will give you the same exact password that you had generated!
### GOOD LOCK !
