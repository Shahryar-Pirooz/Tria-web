# Tria
## Remember <b>Tria</b>,<br/>So you can forget your<br/>old passwords!
Generate a super-secure password,
without having to remember it.
## And the question is ...Why Tria?
- Nothing will be saved anywhere!
- Super strong passwords!
- Convenient and easy to use!

## Using tria is simple, all you need to do is to give tria
- A name, which can be any name you like (e.g. Michael)
- A simple code that's easy to remember (e.g. 1234)
- A domain of the website you want the password for (e.g. facebook.com)
You donâ€™t need to remember or take note of the password because you can always come back, input the name,code and domain and tria will give you the same exact password that you had generated!

# Good Lock!
